#  Tic-Tac-Toe Variants in C++

This project is a collection of various **Tic-Tac-Toe** games implemented in C++, ranging from classic 3x3 to advanced and creative variations such as Word-based, MisÃ¨re, Ultimate, and Numerical versions. It's designed as a fun and educational way to explore different game rules, logic structures, and C++ programming patterns.

##  Game Variants Included

| File(s)                   | Variant Description |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| `SUS_Main.cpp` + `SUS.h` | Standard 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe |
| `TicTacToe4x4.h`         | 4x4 grid Tic-Tac-Toe |
| `main5x5.cpp`, `5x5X_O.h`| 5x5 grid version |
| `mainMisere.cpp`, `Misere.h` | MisÃ¨re variant (you lose if you make 3 in a row) |
| `mainNumerical.cpp`, `numricalTicTacToe.h` | Numerical version (win by summing 15 in a line) |
| `Word_Tic_Tac_Main.cpp`, `Word_tic_tac_toe.h` | Word-based version |
| `mainFourInrow.cpp`, `fourInrow.h` | Four-in-a-row game |
| `Pyramid_X_O.cpp`, `Pyramid_X_O.h` | Pyramid-style board logic |
| `ultimateXOmain.cpp`, `ultimateXO.h` | Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe (board within a board) |
| `FinalSUS.h`             | Possibly final or enhanced logic for a variant (unsureâ€”needs clarification) |
